  What is it?
  -----------

  This project is intended for my Full Stack Web Developer's Course on Udacity.
  It is a simple local host server that displays movie titles with their respective
  posters and trailers available on mouse-click.

  The Latest Version
  ------------------
  Release 1.0


  Installation
  ------------

  Find the zipped file named 'Movies.zip' with Finder (Mac) or SearchBar (Windows).
  Unzip the files contents onto your Desktop.

  For Windows Users:
  Run the program by double-clicking on the file in the 'Movies' folder named
  'entertainment_center.py'

  For Mac/Unix Users:
  Open Terminal.
  cd in to the "movies" folder.
  In terminal run 'python entertainment_center.py'.

  If the file does not work you may need to modify the file permissons or work as a
  super user. To modify the permissions you can run in the terminal:
  'chmod u+X entertainment_center.py' then re-run the command to open the file as
  stated above.

  After running the python file, it will open your web browser and show the movie listing
  that you can click on to watch each of the 6 trailers provided.
